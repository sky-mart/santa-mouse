# Pololu 3pi+ 2040 Robot default main.py
#
# This script displays the logo screen and gives you
# several options to proceed:
#
# Button A: exit (and return to the REPL)
# Button B: launch the built-in UF2 bootloader
# Button C: select a top-level Python file to run
#
# If nothing is pressed, after a specified delay time,
# a default program runs.  You can customize the
# default program and delay times below.
#
# Setting the delays both to zero will eliminate the
# splash screen and initial beep, running your program
# immediately.  In this case you can still hold B or C
# on startup to activate the associated function.
# (Holding A on startup starts self_test.py.)
#
# If your default program exits normally, this script
# will try to shut off the RGB LEDs, motors, and
# buzzer.  If it raises an exception, it will be
# shown on the screen.  You can get more details about
# the exception from the REPL by running:
#   sys.print_exception(exc)
#
# If you don't need these features, you can of course
# replace this script with your own main.py.
